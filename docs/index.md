# Yet Another SPDNet

Welcome to the documentation for **Yet Another SPDNet**, a robust and tested implementation of SPDNet learning models for Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices.

## Overview

SPDNet is a neural network architecture designed to work with SPD matrices, which are commonly encountered in various domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and biomedical engineering. This implementation provides:

- **Robust operations** on SPD matrices with proper Riemannian geometry
- **Comprehensive testing** to ensure mathematical correctness
- **Modern PyTorch implementation** with automatic differentiation
- **Well-documented API** with clear examples
